    <h1> Art History Lattice </h1>
    <p>
      As an artist myself who has studied many different eras of art history, I could not help but draw connections between the dramatic texts we read and external art historical movements.  As we explored these works I would often be reminded , whether by rhetorical style, stage-setting, theme, or internal logic, of some period of art history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work <i>Nazar the Brave</i> is arguably characterized both in message and style by a certain surreal yet material nature, a complication of viewpoints that may seem primarily realistic but that are then juxtaposed with elements perhaps best described as magical. In short, it can be read as a portrayal of the magical nature of the seemingly rational world. This description is also paralleled in the work’s structure as a fable of sorts, as well as the inclusion of elements such as fantastical battles and kingdoms of giants. It is for these reasons that I see a strong connection between <i>Nazar the Brave</i> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism" target="_blank">magical realism </a> art genre. Although typically associated with Latin American narrative fiction (a connection that I will further explore in the literature lattice), the term magical realism was first coined by the German art critic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Roh target="_blank">Franz Roh </a> in reference to a painterly style serving as an alternate to expressionism known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Objectivity" target="_blank">“Neue Sachlichkeit”</a> or New Objectivity. It is for this reason that this lattice point is grounded in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance" target="_blank">Italian Renaissance </a> is widely known for the plethora of emphatic paintings, sculptures, and architectures that it created. A lesser-known fact, however, is that Renaissance artworks characterized a major shift in the way in which divinity was portrayed in relation to mortals. Namely, the departure from Byzantine works into the Renaissance was accompanied by an increasingly literal grounding of divine figures in the material world. Artists began depicting the most important biblical figures not floating in ambiguous halos of gold, but interacting in the same worldly scenes as mortals. The characters in <i>Ancient Gods</i> in many ways experience a similar transition as they struggle to understand their relation to the gods in the material world, thus defining the connection between <i>Ancient Gods</i> and the Italian Renaissance. Naturally, this point in the lattice is grounded at a sculpture of Michelangelo’s <i>David</i> in Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the clearest relation parameterized by art history to an external viewer is that between <i>Honorable Beggars</i> and Ottoman Art. Indeed, the play deals directly with the almost existential struggle of the artists of the Ottoman Empire, and in this way provides a new lens for viewing the different forms of artwork produced by Istanbul throughout the Ottoman Empire. It is interesting to note that the art of the Ottomans is perhaps most notable in the realm of mosques and other religious complexes. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent" target="_blank">age of Suleyman</a> realized many of these works via the royal architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimar_Sinan" target="_blank"> Sinan </a>, a celebrated Islamic architect (this history forms the basis for the content of the text <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317268/the-architects-apprentice-by-elif-shafak/9780143108306/readers-guide/" target="_blank">The Architect’s Apprentice</a> that I have also included in my lattice). This point of the graph is thus grounded at the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.
    </p>

      Having drawn these connections, I gained a new perspective on how the internal logics of these three plays relate to one another. That is, all three of the art historical movements mentioned here arose as the result of some new form of reasoning — whether psychological, religious, or political, respectively — that consequently informed a new artistic style. These different motivations thus allow the texts to challenge and speak to one another. Namely, although this lattice-based analysis suggests that all three of the works deal with themes of honor and power, I now see ways in which their portrayals of what constitutes power challenge one another as defined by their art historical relations. The motivations behind these art historical genres characterize the depiction of power. In <i>Nazar the Brave</i>, power is portrayed as having tangible material consequences and yet the acquisition of power is laughably arbitrary and surreal. This logic is clearly parallel to that informing magical realist artworks. The aforementioned classification of power thus immediately counters the presentation of power in <i>Ancient Gods</i>. In this work, power over one’s internal motivations can in no way be arbitrarily acquired. The Young Monk undergoes a conscious shift and struggle with the elements of the natural world — mainly the sea — that ultimately intertwines him with the gods that call him. No mere quest will suffice in attaining power, for that matter — the Blind Monk’s attempt for spiritual progress by gouging out his own eyes was all “in vain.” This worldly-grounded interplay between mortals and immortals is informed by the same logic that dictated the metamorphosis in depictions of divinity in the Italian Renaissance — a shift that suggests the necessity of grounded internal quest for true power over one’s self to be obtained. This dialogue about the requisites for power is further complicated by introducing the logic behind power as defined by Ottoman art. The religious architecture emerging from this period is largely characterized by mosques or other grandiose religious monuments being commissioned to honor the name of the Sultan or other royals. Indeed, <i>Honorable Beggars</i> explores a similar dynamic as it analyzes the way in which artists of the time were in some ways forced to make their living by inflating the egos of their patrons. This inherently suggests that the notion of power can be bequeathed by the work of others — a viewpoint that perhaps the magical realist portrayals of power in <i>Nazar the Brave</i> can reconcile with, but that grounded Italian Renaissance-esque logic of power in <i>Ancient Gods</i> inherently contradicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, this lattice creates an interesting interplay between the power dynamics of the three works as parameterized by their art historical underpinnings. The logic of the art historical genres mentioned here all make suggestions about what defines the acquisition of power, thus informing the dialogue between the dramatic texts in regards to the logic of power and honor.

    Naturally, connections can be made between these dramatic texts and other works of literature. For this lattice, I focused on connections with non-theatrical works of literature to provide a new perspective on the textual interactions via external literatures.
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned in the analysis of the art history lattice, I found <i>Nazar the Brave</i> to create a very interesting dialogue with magical realist works. 100 Years of Solitude is one of the most famous exemplifications of magical realism in Latin American narrative fiction. Perhaps the strongest reason that I could not help but notice the connections between this novel and <i>Nazar the Brave</i> is due to the strong female characters that in many ways guide the entirety of the plot of each work. Nazar’s Ustian and the Buendia family’s Ursula each serve as the grounding sense of logic as the plots of each of these works navigate a somewhat timeless and circular quest that ultimately end up right where they began.
  </p>
  <p>
    The connection between <i>Ancient Gods</i> and Greek mythology is quite apparent given the exploration of divinities and their connections with the natural world. Indeed, Greek mythologies often mingle the worlds of the gods and their worshippers, a theme that in many ways drives the plot of <i>Ancient Gods</i>. More specifically, I was inclined to draw this connection due to parallels between the Young Monk’s quest and that of Hercules — both strive to reach a form of connection with the gods that at the same time requires struggling against them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317268/the-architects-apprentice-by-elif-shafak/9780143108306/readers-guide/" target="_blank">The Architect’s Apprentice</a> is likely a less-known work than the previous two. Its plot follows the life of an apprentice, who immigrated to Istanbul from India,  to the Chief Royal Architect Sinan during the reign of Sultan Suleyman at the height of the Ottoman Empire. Besides the obvious connection in setting and time period, I drew this connection with <i>Honorable Beggars</i> due to the interesting contrast that the main character Jahan creates with Apisoghom Agha. Both are visitors in the capital city, yet one from the perspective of the artist and the other from that of the patron.
  </p>
  <p>
    These literary connections create an interesting groundwork for a dialogue between the characters of the three dramatic texts influenced by the characters in the external works that I have paralleled them with. That is, tying these external characters into the dialogues broadens the scope of the points that they discuss.

    <h1> Historical Eras Lattice </h1>
    <p>
      This lattice of connections to historical eras is at some points defined by the time in which the work was written, but more generally aims to understand the way in which the texts interact based on events that occurred in historical periods defined by similar logics as those dictating the inner workings of these texts.
    </p>
    <p>
      While reading <i>Nazar the Brave</i>, we discussed the how a relatively common occurrence during the Soviet era was to use children’s novels to hide political messages in a medium unlikely to be censored by the regime. This raises an interesting external connection with <i>Ancient Gods</i>, which I linked with Italian Fascism due to the themes in the book that implicated that religion may in some senses be used as a form of ultra-nationalism grounded not truly in a belief in the religion, but in an attempt to create a collective identity and a certain form of self-validation. To provide some background, Italy up until the late 19th century was not unified as a nation and Italians had a history characterized by fragmentation and lack of a cohesive ethnic identity. As such, the rise of fascism is largely attributed to the need to create a sense of return to the “golden age” of the prosperous Roman empire and make up for embarrassing Italian defeats in international affairs, such as the first World War. Namely, these connections to Fascist Italy and Soviet Russia create a dialogue between <i>Ancient Gods</i> and <i>Nazar the Brave</i> in regards to how political forces influenced the inner workings of the text. <i>Honorable Beggars</i> can naturally be added to this dialogue due to its setting in the Ottoman Empire, yet another largely influential political power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, these historical connections create an interesting dialogue between the texts in regards to how political powers influenced their content.
