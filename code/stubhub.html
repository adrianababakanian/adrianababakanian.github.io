    <h1 class="section-title"> StubHub Community</h1>
    <h4 class="section-subtitle"> As an eBay intern during Summer 2017, I worked as a part
      of StubHub's Search Infrastructure engineering team. In addition to contributing towards
      thr SI team by developing for UI engineering stories using the Scrum framework, I also
      created and then developed a community platform for StubHub users. The platform aims to
      increase engagement on StubHub through a data-oriented approach with impact in customer
      service efficiency, partnerships, and search engine optimization.
      <br>
      <br>
      I used techologies such as internal JavaScript libraries, Dust, RequireJS, Sass, HTML,
      and JavaScript, as well as analytics tracking & A/B testing implementation, performance
      testing, cross-browser quality assurance, loacalization, and several external SDKs in both
      Web and mobile Web.

        <div class="content-text">
            The main goal of the community feature is to collect user-generated content
            and then utilize it to augment the end-to-end user experience. I worked closely
            with product designers, user reserchers, analytics teams, customer service
            databases, Scrum teams, and more at every step of the pipeline to implement a
            method for data collection and utilization as opposed to simply hard-coding a static
            platform displaying UGC. I made design and implementation decisions by consulting
            data collected across thousands of customer service calls, analyzing the results of
            usability testing with external users, and consulting company leaders to receive
            feedback based on partnerships and long-term strategy. I also localized all code to
            be used across all of StubHub's domains in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Spain,
            Germany, and more.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through this experience in which I regularly wrote and deployed
            production- integrated code and pitched my development to high-stake company leaders on
            almost a daily basis, I have developed a technical skill set in ideating, producing, and
            leading at high efficiency rates.
