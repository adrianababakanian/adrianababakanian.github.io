    <h1 class="section-title"> Mo - An Agile Tread Robot </h1>
    <h4 class="section-subtitle sub"> As both an engineer and a designer, prototyping is for me one of the
      most rewarding forms of art. In spring 2017, I took a class at UC Berkeley's <a href="http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/our-space/" target="_blank">Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation</a> on
      prototyping and fabrication where my final project was to design, engineer, build, and program a Bluetooth-controlled
      robot vehicle from scratch with the ultimate goal of navigating hands-free through a mystery obstacle course.
      I worked with the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank"> Arduino IDE</a>, <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3" target="_blank"> Arduino Uno</a> microcontrollers, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2479" target="_blank"> Adafruit Bluefruit</a> modules,
      <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463" target="_blank"> neopixels</a>, and other electronics to motorize
      and control a chassis-based robot constructed from scratch using 3D modeling, laser cutting, and other prototyping
      equipment.
      <br>
      <br>
      Below, I have created a walk-through of my creative engineering process that went behind the creation of Mo, along with some
      videos of Mo in action!

            Since I created Mo completely from scratch, I designed, engineered, and printed all non-electronic parts of Mo in

            allows for desiging, engineering, and simulating. I went through many iterations of designing in order to get the chassis of the robot
            just right. Factors to consider included properly designating internal space for the electronics, engineering the motor compartments and
            accompanying fasteners, and designing for the inclusion of magnets to solidfy the encasing structure while also allowing for easy access to
            the internal electronics.
            <br></br>
            Below are some different views of the Fusion file I created for Mo's chassis.

            The finalized, full-poly version of the chassis and hinged door took almost 12 hours to print on the
            <a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-2-plus" target="_blank"> Ultimaker 2+</a>, a wonderful and
            user-friendly 3D printer. All of my tweaking, precise measuring, and iterating paid off when I ended up with the
            compact and flush chassis shown below.

        <div class="content-text">
            Since one of the main challeneges in the final exam obstacle course was a steeply-inclined ramp
            that needed to be both ascended and descended, I decided to engineer Mo as a tread-based robot in order to be able to face the
            challenge of simultaneously having the capacity to ascend surely and descend without slipping. I 3D-printed dozens of treads that
            I hooked together using fine metal rods, which ultimately encased two laser-cut acrylic faces that enclosed the three gears
            composing the triangular-shaped tread hold.
            <br></br>
            Designing the files to be sent to the laser-cutter required just as many iterations as did the 3D chassis files. I made 2D laser cut
            files in <a href="">Illustrator</a> with appropriately placed and sized holes for gears I 3D printed to match with the tread cable.
            Once everything was cut and printed, I sandwiched the gears between the acrylic walls and held everything together with nuts and bolts
            and appropriate spacers. This made for an easy way to fit the cable tread over the gears while allowing for future iterations.
            <br></br>
            I designed the lead gears to attach to the motors that nested in Mo's chassis, so the treads were firmly connected to the chassis body
            while also being easily adjustable as shown below.

        <div class="content-text">
            One of my goals throughout the process of constructing the robot was to make all of the parts structurally reliable while allowing for
            flexibility. As such, I compartamentalized Mo's design in order to allow for an easy take-apart process to facilitate debugging, electronic
            access, updates, and maintenance. In addition to the treads being easily removed from the chassis body, and the treads being easily
            deconstructed, I also engineered a flushed mangentized door that enabled a quick take-apart process with very little structural interference.
            <br></br>
            In the video below I have provided a quick demo of Mo's sturdy decomposability.

            Mo is controllable completely via Bluetooth thanks to an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2479" target="_blank"> Adafruit Bluefruit</a> module
            that I programmed into Mo's circuit board. I coded the controls into an app for both iOS and Android devices.

            After programming Mo's controls, I decided to add a ring of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463" target="_blank"> neopixels</a>
