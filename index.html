      <h1> Feaster </h1>
      <p> Over the past 8 months, I have been working with <a href="https://www.feasterworks.com/" target="_blank">Feaster</a>, a digital marketing platform
        that provides users with custom deals and offers on local food and drink via <a href="https://www.getfeaster.com/" target="_blank">Facebook Messenger</a>. Through Feaster I have
        had the opportunity to fully create and execute a visual identity, marketing materials,
        a landing page, and more for a startup that I am very excited and honored to be an integral component of.
    </div>
    <div class="introimage-wrapper"><div class="introimage"><img src="assets/images/feaster8.png"></div></div>

      <h2 class="tech"> Logo Iterations </h2>
      <p> My first task as a member of the Feaster team was to develop a logo and logo text to fuel all of our
        branding identity. My goal was to communicate to the user the key features that Feaster delivers &mdash; that is,
        an optimal way to receive personalized deals on local food and drink while saving money. </p>
      <p> I started off by brainstorming with some rather cliche illustrations iconic of eating and savings, as well as lettering
        many iterations of the word "Feaster." </p>
    </div>
      <div class="introimage-wrapper"><div class="introimage gray"><img src="assets/images/brainstorm-min.png" class="hor"></div></div>
      <div class="caption"> <p><em> A sample of the brainstorming process behind the Feaster logo and logo text. </em> </p></div>
      <div class="workcontent">
        <p> After some more brainstorming, I came up with the idea of a piggy bank. Pigs are iconic of eating,
          and piggy banks are iconic of saving. I decided to add a fork and spoon on the surface of the piggy bank
          to empahsize the use of this bank as a place for storing the savings a user would garner
          by using Feaster. </p>
        <p> The piggy bank also went through an iterative process. I started off by forming the structure of the pig out of
          overlapping circles, and then moved on to refine the overall shape and details of the shading.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="introimage-wrapper"><div class="introimage"><img src="assets/images/circlepig2.png"></div></div>
      <div class="caption"> <p> <em> A behind-the-scenes look at how I created the structure of the piggy bank in
      Feaster's logo. </em> </p></div>
      <div class="workcontent">
        <p> Since this was the first time that I had the repsonsbility of creating such a unique logo that was to be used extensively for the branding of
          a company, I completely underestimated the amount of itertaing I would embark upon after the basic structure of the logo was implemented. Even though
          I have always been a chronic perfectionist, I even began to get on my own nerves as I hyperfocused on every detail of the logo. But the amount of time I
          spent making sure every stroke was perfect was more than worth it. It was extremely rewarding to watch something progress from a rudimentary to a much more
          refined state, and I now feel much more knowledgable about what it takes to implement something as crucial as a brand's logo. </p>

          how the landing page was made! </p>
        <h2 class="tech"> Marketing Materials </h2>
        <p> Once a business signs up with Feaster, it is then of course crucial that the business owners have the proper materials
          to market their offers on Feaster to their customers. Currently, one of my main roles at Feaster is creating these marketing
          materials that businesses either dispaly in their restaurants or hand out to their customers. </p>

      <h1> Map of Berkeley </h1>
      <p> I love the architecture of my school. It somehow manages to be simultanously ecelectic and cohesive, and never fails to inspire me
        regardless of how many times I sleepwalk through campus on my way to lecture or leave a building after a not-so-fun midterm. Because of it's beauty
        I decided to make an illustrated map of <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>. Below are some of the buildings I have completed so far &mdash; check back soon to see more illustrations of
        our beautiful architecture and the final

      <p> The architecture included here so far, in my opinion, captures the some of the most "Berkeley-esque" features
        of campus. Muted mint greens, coppery corals, grayish off-whites, and relaxed navy blues are the most prominent colors
        that come to mind when I think of our campus. </p>

          little pieces have shown up in my other works &mdash; if you look you at my other projects, you will find them! </p>

      <h1> Innovative Design </h1>
      <p> I joined <a href="http://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank"> Innovative Design</a> during my Spring semester of my freshman
        year at Cal. We are UC Berkeley's premier creative agency, and our purpose is making Berkeley beautiful! InnoD is organized into different tiers &mdash;
        graphic design, photography, videography, and web design. These last two semesters, I was a part of a graphic design tier called Gold Tier.
        This semster, I am very excited to be on InnoD's Marketing Tier. Our client is InnoD itself &mdash; we create marketing materials for club recruitement
        campaigns, club events such as our <a href="http://hex.innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank"> HEX Workshops</a>
        & <a href="http://cmyk.innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank"> CMYK Designathon</a>, and more. </p>

      <h2 class="tech"> Spring 2017 Recruitement Campaign </h2>
      <p> Our theme for recruitement this semester was "build your nest." We ultimatley wanted to convey the idea that InnoD is a creative home
        for all of its members. Each semester we create several iterations of flyers to pass out on campus during recruitement season. Below are the
        four iterations we created for this season. Each flyer depicts a representation of the workspace for a member from each of the four different tiers of the club. I was responsible for
        making the desk of the graphic designer. I love how these turned out &mdash; they do an excellent job of capturing the spirit of Innovative Design. </p>

      <h2 class="tech"> InnoD Logo Design </h2>
      <p> Part of our recruitement campaign every semester is making a new logo out of our existing logo. InnoD's logo is made of three cascading, overlapping circles &mdash;
        which gives virtually a blank canvas to turn it into whatever you can imagine! This semester I created the design shown below as our new logo. You can see it as the profile
        picture for our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/InnovativeDesignUCB/" target="_blank"> Facebook page </a>.

      <h2 class="tech"> HEX: Hone & Explore Design Workshops </h2>
      <p> Each semester, InnoD holds a series of design workshops hosted by our members open to all students in the
        Berkeley campus community. The goal of these free lessons is to make all types of design accessible to everyone who
        is interested in honing their skills or exploring new ones. This semester I will be running a workshop on Branding and Marketing Design.
        HEX is coming up in just a few weeks, so make sure to check back for all of the finalized marketing materials as well as
        a summary of the workshop I will be teaching! </p>
      <h2 class="tech"> Brainstorming: HEX Theme </h2>
      <p> Every semester we come up with a different idea for the theme of HEX. Since HEX stands for "Hone & Explore," we try to
        brainstorm ideas that communicate that the mission of HEX is to be a fun adventure in design education. This semester, we
        decided to brand the event with the overall theme of vintage adventure maps, retro national park posters, and Boy Scout-inspired
        badges and pins. I am very exicted for the final products! <p>
      <p> Below are some of my sketches brainstorming ideas for the buttons, stickers, flyers, and other marketing materials that
         we are going to hand out while advertising HEX. </p>

      <h1> WeatherOrNot </h1>
      <p> This project is a Rails webapp called WeatherOrNot, an applictaion that utilizes user feedback forms to create
        personalized suggestions about what to wear based on the weather of a given day. The inspiration behind the app is that, rather often,
        the same weather conditions feel quite different for different people. WeatherOrNot is a way for users to always know how to dress prepared
        without having to take any extra time out of their morning rotinues. </p>

      <p> This past semester I took a course about Ruby on Rails. The course covered many of the integral features and powers
        of the "Rails magic," and I loved it so much that I have started working on developing some side projects on my own
        using the Rails framework. (In fact, I have gotten so used to firing up the Rails server that I initially developed this
        site in Rails and then converted it to pure HTML/CSS/JS to put up on GitHub pages.) Rails is the first backend framework that I worked
        with, and it has definitely inspired me to continue exploring backend development. </p>
      <p> WeatherOrNot began as my final group project for the Rails course mentioned above.
        After the semester completed, I forked our project repo and continued to work on the app on my own. As of now, it is still a work in progres. A few of the features
        I have implemented and am in the process of implementing are: <p>
          <ul>
            <li> AJAX calls to a Weather API in order to gather realtime weather stats (Previously, I seeded the database with random weather instances.
              The user can select if they want to see real data or random data to play around with more diverse weather conditions.) </li>
            <li> Integrated Bootstrap to add to the styling I previously implemented with vanilla CSS. </li>
            <li> Improved the UI of the daily feedback forms. </li>
            <li> Added a calendar which can be used to access and edit feedback forms from previous days. </li>
          </ul>

      <h1> Feaster Landing Page </h1>
      <p> As part of my role as Feaster's Marketing & Branding Designer, I created a <a href="https://www.feasterworks.com" target="_blank">landing page</a> to provide businesses with information about the services and benefits
        that Feaster provides. I created all of the icons and illustrations on the page, made mockups of the layout, and added CSS styling to the site. Overall I had a
        lot of fun with this project because it allowed me to utilize both my graphic design and web development skillsets, as well as create a product that realworld
        businesses are accessing and using. </p>

        through the accompying text. Below are some of the mockups I made in Sketch of the aforementioned sections. </p>

      <h1> Personal Site Iteration </h1>
      <p> I for some reason decided that it would be a good idea to build up a personal site from scratch &mdash; no Bootstrap templates,
        no frameworks, just a blank HTML document with equally blank stylesheets and scripts. Although I am aware that all of the resources for
        developers out there render this approach rather impratical, I am very glad that I did it. I've never been more confident in my understanding
        of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it was a lot of fun and extremely rewarding to be able to StackOverflow my way through every obstacle that I
        encountered and end up with a product that is completely my own! </p>
      <p> <em> Note: for now, please fullscreen your browser, since I am in the process of optimizing the responsiveness of the homepage! </em> </p>
    </div>
    <div class="introimage-wrapper"><div class="introimage"><img src="assets/images/mysite.png"></div></div>
    <div class="workcontent">
      <h2 class="tech"> Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass </h2>
      <p> During my first semester of college, I took a course called <em> The Web Design Decal </em>. It was in this class that I was first exposed to
        the basics of web development. I fell in love immediately. I have been wanting to code up a personal site ever since, and I am very happy to share the
        final result! </p>
      <h2 class="tech"> The Process </h2>
      <p> My ultimate goal with this site was to create something that fits with my style as both a designer and developer. This site isn't just a place
        to showcase my projects, but also one of my projects itself. </p>
      <p> I started off by defining my color palette, settig up a layout, and choosing fonts. I also made some fun icons that pop up throughtout the site,
        adding an element of interactiveness to make the site more than just a static portfolio.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="introimage-wrapper"><div class="introimage"><img src="assets/images/personal.png"></div></div>
    <div class="workcontent">
      <p> The layout I started out with was a very basic one. I had a standard navbar dividing the site up into a few
        different categories, and clicking on each link led to a different page. After implementing this layout, I
        got pretty bored of looking at it. I wanted instead something that was a bit more fluid, a bit more interactive,
        and a lot more fun. So I decide to reimplement the layout into a one page site </p>
      <p> Currently, all of the content is "stored" either off to the side or at the bottom of the viewport. I implemented page
        transitions using a combination of CSS and jQuery animations. A menu is also "stored" to the left of the viewport, which
        a visitor to my site can use to navigate from section to section. </p>
      <h2 class="tech"> Conclusion </h2>
      <p> I had a lot of fun implementing this site. I feel so much more confident in not only my web devleopment abilities,
        but also my problem-solving abilities in both coding and learning in general. </p>
      <p class="bottom"> I'm happy to say that I was able to create a product that feels very "me," and I'm now even more exited to keep
        learning and developing. </p>
