    <h2>Community Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
    This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. Last updated August 27, 2018.
    <br/><br/>
    Everyone participating in the Cal Hacks community—including, but not limited to the hackathon and Slack channel—is required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. This includes all attendees, speakers, performers, patrons (sponsors), volunteers, and staff.
    <br/><br/>
    Cal Hacks is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
    <br/><br/>
    Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Cal Hacks organizers.
    <br/><br/>
    <h2>Definitions</h2>

    <ul>

    <p>Cal Hacks prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.</p>
    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Cal Hacks may take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Cal Hacks spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Cal Hacks community members or the general public.</p>
    <h2>Reporting and Enforcement</h2>
    <p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Cal Hacks community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us immediately via email at team@calhacks.io.</p>
    <h2>Hackathon</h2>
    <p>Please contact any member of our production, volunteer or security team. Our team can be identified by their “Director” t-shirts, and will be trained in how to address and report any incidents that attendees bring to their attention.</p>
    <h2>Slack</H2>
    <p>Please contact an admin or moderator via direct message.</p>
    <p>If the person who is harassing you is a member of staff, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.</p>
    <p>All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>
    <p>Thanks</p>
    <p>This Code of Conduct was written based upon the Code of Conduct for XOXO Fest.</p>
